## Overview

This project is a **technical gameplay demo** created to demonstrate the ability to design and implement a complete Match-3 system in Unity. The focus is on **gameplay logic, grid systems, and clean, maintainable code**, rather than monetization or live-service features.

Key features include:

* Grid-based **Match-3 gameplay**
* **Tile swapping and match detection**
* Cascading matches and board refilling
* Basic animations and visual feedback
* Clear separation of game logic and presentation
* Modular and extendable code structure

This project is part of my portfolio to demonstrate my **Unity gameplay programming skills**. The source code is **fully available** for review.
